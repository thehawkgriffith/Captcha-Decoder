# Capthca-Decoder
A capthca decoder created with Python 3, using libraries keras, imutils, numpy, cv2, pickle and sklearn.
Works on Deep Learning through a Convolutional Neural Network.
Sequential() class model from the keras library.
Image processing done through the imutils library, and feeded into the CNN, trained on a 0.25 train_test_split.
